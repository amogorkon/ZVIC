
# Spec 01: Introduction

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document introduces the foundational paradigms of Signature-Driven Functional Programming (SDFP) and Zero-Version Interface Contracts (ZVIC), which underpin the JustUse project. It defines the motivation, scope, and intended audience for these specifications.

**Scope:**
- Overview of SDFP and ZVIC paradigms
- Key principles and definitions
- High-level use cases

**Audience:**
Developers, architects, and DevOps engineers working with dynamic, distributed Python systems who seek to improve code reliability and maintainability without the overhead of traditional versioning.

## 2. Specification Overview

Traditional versioning and interface management approaches often lead to dependency drift, compatibility issues, and slow iteration cycles. The SDFP and ZVIC paradigms address these challenges by focusing on function signatures and runtime contract validation, enabling safer hot-reloads and more reliable code reuse. JustUse is a project that applies these paradigms to real-world distributed systems.

## 3. Goals & Requirements

### Goals
- Eliminate the need for semantic versioning in shared code
- Enable safe, hot-reloadable modules
- Provide runtime guarantees for interface compatibility
- Facilitate rapid development and deployment cycles

## 4. Core Definitions

- **Signature-Driven Functional Programming (SDFP):** A runtime programming paradigm where the behavior and lifecycle of functional code is governed by the structure of its function signatures, not by external configuration or versioning.
- **Zero-Version Interface Contracts (ZVIC):** A paradigm for managing code compatibility without version numbers, relying on runtime verification of callable structure.
- **JustUse:** A project that applies SDFP and ZVIC paradigms to enable safe, dynamic code reuse in distributed Python systems.
