
# Scrum Log Week 2025-28


## Tuesday

### Done since last update:
- [x] All annotation constraints are now transformed to `Annotated[type, constraint]` (defaulting to `Annotated[type, ""]` if no constraint).
- [x] The AST transformer (`annotation_constraints.py`) recursively transforms all annotation calls, including nested and complex types.
- [x] The normalization layer (`type_normalization.py`) robustly detects and handles both `typing.Annotated` and `typing_extensions.Annotated`.
- [x] Demo script (`demo_type_normalization.py`) now reads a real module, applies the transformation, and prints both type hints and normalized forms.
- [x] Debug output added to normalization for troubleshooting mismatches in `Annotated` detection.
- [x] Test suite updated: all conditional type checks replaced with strict asserts for clarity and reliability.
- [x] Ruff and Pylance are configured to ignore expected warnings for demo/test code.

### Next up / To do:
- [ ] Document the new normalization and transformation pipeline for contributors.
- [ ] Review and refactor any remaining legacy normalization logic.
- [ ] Remove debug output and finalize robust `Annotated` detection in normalization.
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases and complex/nested annotations.

### Impediments / Blockers:
None at the moment.

### Decisions Made:
- Clean up and strictly assert test logic for type normalization.
- Guarantee type normalization and canonicalization work seamlessly with the new convention.


## Thursday


### Done since last update:
- [x] Reformatted the scrum log to strictly follow the README conventions (daily sections, checkboxes, explicit blockers, etc.).
- [x] Updated and redistributed tasks and progress into the correct daily sections for clarity and compliance.
- [x] Maintained a clear audit trail and structure for ongoing and future updates.
- [x] Implemented a universal `_` placeholder class for type constraints, enabling removal of linter exceptions in demo and test code.

### Next up / To do:
- [ ] Continue updating daily progress and blockers as the week progresses.
- [ ] Ensure all new work is logged under the correct day and section.

### Impediments / Blockers:
None at the moment.

### Decisions Made:
- Adopted and enforced the scrum log conventions as per `docs/scrum/README.md`.

### Open Questions:
