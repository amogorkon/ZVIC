# Scrum Log Week 2025-34
## Monday

### Done since last update:
- Implemented decision to remove regex fallback and prefer CrossHair where available.
- Added a conservative AST-based heuristic to catch simple numeric narrowing.
- Ran full test-suite: 92 passed.

### Next up / To do:
- Consider broader heuristic coverage (optional).

### Impediments / Blockers:
- None immediate. CrossHair availability varies by environment; tests pass without it due to the heuristic.

### Decisions Made:
- Remove regex fallback. CrossHair-first, AST-heuristic fallback, permissive otherwise. See summary above.

### Open Questions:
- Should we expand the heuristic or instead require CrossHair in CI to ensure semantic verification?
