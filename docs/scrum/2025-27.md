# Scrum Log Week 2025-27

## Tuesday

### Done since last update:
- [x] Initialized new ZVIC project repository and directory structure
- [x] Created initial documentation and specs (README, SDFP & ZVIC spec)
- [x] Set up Python project with test infrastructure (pytest, conftest, test modules)
- [x] Implemented core canonicalize() and is_compatible() logic for signature contracts
- [x] Added basic tests and fixtures for dynamic module loading
- [x] Integrated advanced canonicalization logic (enums, dataclasses, pydantic stubs)

### Next up / To do:
- [ ] Implement full enum, dataclass, and pydantic model canonicalization and compatibility checks
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases and new types
- [ ] Document usage and developer guidelines
- [ ] Set up CI for automated testing and linting

### Impediments / Blockers:
- None at the moment.

### Decisions Made:
- Adopted contract-first, signature-driven approach for all interface compatibility
- Chose Python 3.12+ with modern typing and match/case for extensibility
- Decided to support enums, dataclasses, and Pydantic models as first-class contract types

### Open Questions:
- Should we support additional schema types (e.g., TypedDict, Protocol) in the initial release?
- What is the minimum compatibility policy for default values and field ordering in dataclasses?
